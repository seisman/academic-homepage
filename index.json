Such a localized mushy zone is found to be\nsurrounded by a sharp inner core boundary nearby. These seismic results suggest\nthat, in the current thermo-compositional state of the Earth’s core, the outer\ncore composition is close to eutectic in most regions resulting in a sharp\ninner core boundary, but deviation from the eutectic composition exists\nin some localized regions resulting in a mushy zone with a thickness of 4–8 km.\n","tags":[],"title":"Seismological evidence for a localized mushy zone at the Earth’s inner core boundary","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1474419600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1474419600,"objectID":"528a7782b849a603b0ccb00b54fa8aa0","permalink":"https://me.seisman.info/talk/gmt-eqhb-2016/","publishdate":"2016-09-21T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/gmt-eqhb-2016/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Getting started with GMT in 60 minutes","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467248400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467248400,"objectID":"27af2187350887235f036dc651f5ec89","permalink":"https://me.seisman.info/talk/icb-cenc-2016/","publishdate":"2016-06-30T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/icb-cenc-2016/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Seismic stduy on the properties of the Earth's inner core boundary","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Xiaohan Chen","Dongdong Tian","Lianxing Wen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1442793600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1442793600,"objectID":"906ae1fe047895a173da57e89ee5f072","permalink":"https://me.seisman.info/publication/2015_hurrican-sandy/","publishdate":"2015-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_hurrican-sandy/","section":"publication","summary":"We find that microseisms generated by Hurricane Sandy exhibit coherent energy\nwithin 1 h time windows in the frequency band of 0.1–0.25 Hz, but with signals\ncorrelated among seismic stations aligned along close azimuths from the\nhurricane center. With the identification of this signal property, we show\nthat travel time difference can be measured between the correlated stations.\nThese correlated seismic signals can be attributed to two types of seismic\nsources, with one group of the seismic signals from the hurricane center and\nthe other from coastal region. The seismic sources in coastal region are\ndiffusive and move northward along the coastline as Sandy moves northward.\nWe further develop a hurricane seismic source model, to quantitatively describe\nthe coupling among sea level pressure fluctuations, ocean waves, and solid Earth\nin the region of hurricane center and determine the evolution of source's\nstrength and pressure fluctuation in the region of hurricane center using\nseismic data. Strong seismic sources are also identified near the coastal region\nin New England after Sandy's dissipation, possibly related to subsequent storm\nsurge in the area. The seismic method may be implemented as another practical\nmeans for hurricane monitoring, and seismological estimates of the hurricane\nseismic source model could be used as in situ proxy measurements of pressure\nfluctuation in the region of hurricane center for hurricane physics studies.\n","tags":[],"title":"Microseismic sources during Hurricane Sandy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miao Zhang","Dongdong Tian","Lianxing Wen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1393372800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393372800,"objectID":"662955765c328ee0eb36cfdb5dcb0ff4","permalink":"https://me.seisman.info/publication/2014_autocorrelograms-stacking/","publishdate":"2014-02-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014_autocorrelograms-stacking/","section":"publication","summary":"Accurate determination of earthquake depth is important, but particularly\nchallenging. We develop a new method to determine the earthquake source depth\nby stacking multiple-station autocorrelograms (SMAC) of seismic data.\nThe basic concept of SMAC method is to enhance the coherent surface reflected\nenergy by autocorrelation and stacking, and uses the surface reflected energy\nto determine the source depth. Autocorrelation effectively enhances the energy\nof the seismic phases related to the source depth, while stacking the\nautocorrelograms of array data further improves the signal-to-noise ratio of\nthe energy. The procedures are applied using both the main SH waves and the coda.\nUsing coda waves, the method extracts the two-way traveltime between the source\nand the surface by stacking the coda wave autocorrelations over an array of\nseismic observations. Using the main SH waves, SMAC explores the interference\nof the down-going Moho reflected SmS wave and up-going surface bounced Moho\nreflected sSmS wave by autocorrelation. The autocorrelograms are then stacked\nalong theoretical differential sSmS–SmS traveltime predicted for all potential\nsource depths, and the source depth is determined to be the one that produces\nthe maximum stacking energy. Synthetic tests demonstrate the validity of the\nSMAC procedures. As an example of application, we apply the SMAC method to\ndetermine the source depth of an earthquake occurring in Japan Island.\nThe procedures of using both main SH waves and their coda waves yield robust\nsurface reflected energy and a consistent source depth. The error of the depth\nestimation is less than 1 km assuming an uncertainty of 10 per cent\nin the averaged crust velocity.\n","tags":[],"title":"A new method for earthquake depth determination: stacking multiple-station autocorrelograms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Download my full CV here.\n Education  2018: PhD in Geophysics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, 2012: BSc in Geophysics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China,   Employment  2018/08–present: Postdoctoral Research Associate, Michigan State University, East Lansing, US   Professional Societies \u0026amp; Services  2012–present: Member of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) 2013–present: Author of the SeisMan blog (pupoular in Chinese young seismologists) 2016–2018: Research Assistant and database manager for China Seismological Reference Model 2016–present: Founder and primary contributor of GMT China Community 2017–present: Peer-reviewer of scientific journals: Geophysical Research Letters (1), Seismological Research Letters (2), Review of Scientific Instruments (1), Journal of Open Source Software (2) 2018–present: Core developer of the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) and PyGMT 2018–2019: Judge for the Outstanding Student Paper Award, AGU Fall Meeting 2019–2020: Instructor for the UNAVCO Short Course \u0026ldquo;The Generic Mapping Tools for Geodesy\u0026rdquo; 2019: Instructor for the Workshop SCIWS4: Become a Generic Mapping Tools Contributor Even If You Can\u0026rsquo;t Code, 2019 AGU Fall Meeting   Awards \u0026amp; Honors  2018: President Award, Chinese Academy of Science, China.

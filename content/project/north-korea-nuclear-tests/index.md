title: North Korea Nuclear Tests
summary: |
  North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006.
  Using seismological techniques, we determine their high-precison locations,
  yields, and source characteristics of the six nuclear tests and
  associated small seismic events.

### North Korea's September 3 2017 Nuclear Test

#### Main Shock

On 3 September 2017, North Korea conducted sixth nuclear test, which is the
largest one since 2006.

For details of the source characteristic of the 2017 test,
see [Yao et al., 2018, SRL]({{< ref "/publication/2018_north-korea-nuclear-test-2017/index.md" >}}).

#### Collapse event 8.5 minutes after the 2017 test

The 2017 test had resulted in an on-site collapse of the Mt. Mantap.

For details of the collapse event after the 2017 test,
see [Tian et al., 2018, GRL]({{< ref "/publication/2018_north-korea-nuclear-test-2017-collapse/index.md" >}}).

#### Seismicty Triggered by the 2017 test

The 2017 test triggered an earthquake swarm 8.4 km north of the nuclear test site.

For details of the earthquake swarm after the 2017 test,
see [Tian et al., 2018, GRL]({{< ref "/publication/2018_north-korea-nuclear-test-2017-collapse/index.md" >}})
and [Yao et al., 2018, SRL]({{< ref "/publication/2018_north-korea-nuclear-test-2017-aftershocks/index.md" >}}).

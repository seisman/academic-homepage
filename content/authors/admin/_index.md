Dongdong Tian is a seismologist. His research is directed toward understanding
the structure of the Earth's deep interior,
mechanisms of seismic sources (e.g., microseismic, explosions, and collapse),
and seismic wave propagation in complex media.

He received his Ph.D. degree in Geophysics from
[University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2018,
advised by [Prof. Lianxing Wen](http://geophysics.geo.sunysb.edu/wen/).
After that, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at
[Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/),
collaborating with Prof. [Songqiao Shawn Wei](https://sites.google.com/a/msu.edu/swei/).
Now he is an Associate Professor at [China University of Geosciences](https://en.cug.edu.cn).

He is also a big fan of open-source and serves as a core developer of the
{{< icon name="terminal" pack="fas" >}} [Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)](https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/),
a widely-used software for processing and visualizing geophysical data in Earth Science,
and its Python wrapper, {{< icon name="python" pack="fab" >}}[PyGMT](https://www.pygmt.org/).

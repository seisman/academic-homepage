By employing an on-site collapse event as a reference and eliminating path effects
of seismic wave propagation, we constrain source characteristics of
North Korea's 3 September 2017 nuclear test. In the framework of a complete source model
for an underground explosion consisting of an isotropic source representing the explosion
and two secondary sources accompanying the explosion, with one represented
by a double-couple (DC) attributed to tectonic release and
the other an oblique compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) attributed to source medium damage,
the source model of the 2017 test is inferred from its noncircular radiation patterns of
Rayleigh and Love waves using seismic observations of the collapse as references.
Based on the opposite azimuths of the inferred oblique CLVD of the test and the collapsing
force of the event 8.5 minutes later, we propose a deformation scenario of the 2017 test
in that the test generates a prompt source medium damage expanding away from the test center
mostly along the direction of 320° (represented by the oblique CLVD) and those deformed
surrounding rocks collapse toward the test center along the weakness direction
in an opposite way 8.5 minutes later (represented by the collapse). We further propose that
an inferred obliqueness of CLVD accompanying a nuclear test may serve an indication of
possible collapsing direction for the test. As the surface wave magnitude is strongly
contaminated by those secondary sources, we estimate the yield of the 2017 test to
be 109.4±48.6 kt based on the body wave Lg-magnitude."""
